  <!-- this was the org in ibiblio.  the package names lead me to believe
       some org called "exolab" used to exist that was in charge of castor...
       i think this is host in sourceforge now instead of codehaus?  dont know
       the difference but don't know what to put here so going with ibiblio. -->

    <!-- this old version of castor was hard to track down exactly, so used
         cacoresdk 3.2 output libs as the baseline mostly.... and tried
         to infer things from the current documentation from the castor web site
         
         there are a lot of feature areas to castor... and it's not clear
         which pieces cacore is actually using, so there may be some
         unnecessary libs in here, and hopefully nothing missing. -->
