<!--
An ivy settings file specifically for eclipse. Makes it read from the default.proprties and local.properties,
which define the local.repo.dir (normally ivy inherits Ant properties, which already include these.

For this to work, you must create a local.properties file in your build directory, even if it's empty.
-->

<ivysettings>
    <properties file="${ivy.settings.dir}/../build/local.properties" override="false"/>
    <properties file="${ivy.settings.dir}/../build/default.properties" override="false"/>
    <include file="${ivy.settings.dir}/ivy-caarray-settings.xml"/>
</ivysettings>
