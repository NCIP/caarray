Introduction
---------------------------
 
caArray is an open-source, web and programmatically
 accessible array data management system. caArray guides the 
annotation and exchange of array data using a federated 
model of local installations whose results are shareable 
across the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG™). 
caArray furthers translational cancer research through 
acquisition, dissemination and aggregation of semantically 
interoperable array data to support subsequent analysis by 
tools and services on and off the Grid. As array technology 
advances and matures, caArray will extend its logical 
library of assay management.

Features
------------------------

This release represents a new generation of the caArray 
software. caArray 2.0 builds from previous the 1.x line by 
organizing the application around the natural workflow 
between investigators and the array labs that serve them, 
enhancing the user experience for storing and retrieving the 
data produced, and providing a simplified API for 
programmatic data query and access.


Highlights of caArray 2.0 include:


* New User Interface and Navigation

The graphical user interface and the navigation through the 
system has been completely revised for caArray 2.0. Users 
have the ability to:


o Browse and Search through the repository for Experiments 
of interest. The search mechanisms lead to actionable 
results that are clear to the end user and incorporate their 
specific rights for the experiments.


o Submit and access array data and annotations based on a 
role-based workflow designed to support collaboration 
between Principle Investigators, Lab Administrators, 
Scientists and Statisticians. Serving as an foundation from 
which discrete workflow features will be added, 2.0 allows
the definition of the experiment, submission to a 
PI-directed and determined set of collaborators, and 
entry of the information. The end-to-end states of an 
experiment are: Draft, In Progress, and Public.


o Upload, validate, and import single files or a set of 
zipped files. The workflow allows for the effort to be 
spread over time and in synch with the way work is performed 
in the lab but also offers the ability to perform bulk 
uploads of annotation and experiment data.


o Control the public visibility of an experiment. One can 
make Public the entire contents of an Experiment or limit 
public visibility to a defined set of Samples within an 
Experiment.


* Java API and Grid Service

The caArray Java API and corresponding caGrid service have 
been significantly modified for Version 2.0, based on 
feedback from the caArray API users. Both interfaces provide 
access to the following services: the caArray Search 
Service, the Data Retrieval Service, the Array Design 
Details Service and the File Retrieval Service. In addition, 
client applications can access data via domain objects 
packaged in the client.jar.


* MAGE-TAB support

MAGE-TAB files – IDF, SDRF, ADF – can be imported to allow 
bulk upload of experiment annotations and associated array 
data files. The original MAGE-TAB files are stored in the 
system intact and are available for download.


* Installation

caArray 2.0 provides a simplified approach to installation 
on Linux and Windows platforms. Much of the installation 
process has been automated such that, if you accept the 
default values, you can install caArray by typing a single 
command. With the exception of the database, all supporting 
tools are automatically installed and configured as part of 
the installation. The installation provides additional 
diagnostics to better ensure the efficacy of the 
installation.

Known Issues/Defects
------------------------
  
See the GForge tracker for the latest use cases (implemented 
and deferred), existing open defects, community requests, 
resolutions and feature requests. The following issues are 
highlighted. 


https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/tracker/?group_id=305

*12161 "Retract Public Experiment" doesn't remove ability to download
 data -- work around is that when the experiment is retracted
 from public visibility and becomes editable, a user can click 
"Permissions" and change the visibility from "Read" to
"Visible" 

*12119 Allow files greater than 1 GB to be uploaded -- the ability to 
upload files is restricted to files (raw or compressed) of 2 GB or less.
It is highly encouraged that upload jobs are no larger that 1 GB.  

*12107  Valid Illumina SNP design files fail validation -- a defect 
exists in the Illumina SNP design file parser that prevents design
files from being imported.

*11756	Grid Service DataSet Retrieval Slower than 
Remote Java API -- due to XML serialization via castor.

*11780	SDRF file does not validate if data files are 
uploaded first -- currently unable to validate SDRF's that 
reference data already uploaded or imported. Remove references to such 
data from the SDRF, or delete referenced uploaded or imported data, 
and it should import smoothly.


*11790	Importing IDF, SDRF, and data files without defining 
Array Design in Experiment Overview -- for ALL Affymetrix, 
Illumina and Genepix experiments where you want to validate 
and import MAGE-TAB data, you must select the array design 
to go with it or add the array design and then select it in 
order for validation and import to be successful. 


*11922	Provide graceful validation failure for unsupported 
Affymetrix CDF files -- currently Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 
ST array can not be read by the AffxFusion jar (see: 
http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=huexon-st 
for more details).
