Introduction
---------------------------
 
caArray is an open-source, web and programmatically
 accessible array data management system. caArray guides the 
annotation and exchange of array data using a federated 
model of local installations whose results are shareable 
across the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG™). 
caArray furthers translational cancer research through 
acquisition, dissemination and aggregation of semantically 
interoperable array data to support subsequent analysis by 
tools and services on and off the Grid. As array technology 
advances and matures, caArray will extend its logical 
library of assay management.

Features
------------------------

This release represents a patch release of the caArray 2.0
software. Over 70 issues have been addressed with few minor enhancements.


Highlights of caArray 2.0.1 include:


* File Upload as a Background Process

The process of uploading files can take an extended period of time 
depending onthe file size and number of files.  As a convenience to 
our application users, the upload function will execute as a background 
process allowing users to interact with the application as upload 
occurs.

* Fix for Importing Illumina SNP Array Designs

Defect #12107 has been fixed such that Illumina SNP array designs can 
be successfully imported. 

* Authenticated access via the Remote Java API is now supported

* Import (Not Parsed) Additional Array Designs

Users can now Import these additional array design types, stored 
unparsed in the database:
Agilent CSV, Agilent XML, ImaGene TPL, Nimblegen NDF, UCSF Spot SPT

* Download All Files from Experiments of Substantial Size

If the size is greater than 150MB (after compression), the System 
breaks up the download into batches of files, each batch with size 
no more than 150MB.
