caArray is an array data management system that goes beyond being a simple repository for microarray data. It is intended to support data and annotation management throughout the life of an experiment, allowing collaborative sharing of pre-publication data with a set of partners. Sophisticated access control is possible at the experiment level or at the level of individual samples. In addition, caArray has adopted a federated model which enables researchers to search data across laboratories around the world which host their own installations of caArray. This is made possible by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). Complementing a user-friendly web interface are rich programmatic APIs that allow analytical tools on and off the Grid (like caIntegrator2, geWorkbench and GenePattern) to pull data from caArray and visualize or analyze it. Data in caArray is based on community standards including MIAME and MAGE-TAB. A bench scientist can use MAGE-TAB to bulk upload data and annotations in a simple familiar spreadsheet format, while at the same time including high-quality annotations referencing controlled vocabularies (like the MGED Ontology and the NCI Thesaurus). caArray also supports bulk update of annotations using MAGE-TAB, merging the old and the new annotations in an intuitive manner, making it easy to update annotations as the experiment progresses. Coming soon in a new release is the ability to export an experiment into SOFT format in preparation for submission to the GEO repository. The NCI Center for Bioinformatics and Information Technology hosts an installation of caArray at https://array.nci.nih.gov. For institutions interested in hosting caArray, user-friendly installers and documentation are available at https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/tools/caArray. caArray is an open source project.
