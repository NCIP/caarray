Introduction
---------------------------
 
caArray is an open-source, web and programmatically
 accessible array data management system. caArray guides the 
annotation and exchange of array data using a federated
model of local installations whose results are shareable 
across the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG™). 
caArray furthers translational cancer research through 
acquisition, dissemination and aggregation of semantically 
interoperable array data to support subsequent analysis by 
tools and services on and off the Grid. As array technology 
advances and matures, caArray will extend its logical 
library of assay management.

Features and Defects Addressed in this Release
-----------------------------------------------

This release represents a minor release of the caArray 2 software. 

Highlights of caArray 2.2.1 are:

* Ability to Change Experiment and Collaborator Group Ownership:
  * A user with system administrator role is able to change the ownership of an experiment and the 
    collaborator group.

* Genepix data files must require an accompanying SDRF and sample names must not be mandated.
  * Genepix GPR data requires accompanying SDRF and IDF files.  Sample names and sample-data 
     relationships are validated against the SDRF.

* API client jars:
  * caArray 2.2.1 is backwards-compatible with programmatic API clients
    using 2.1.0 jars. Please note that the API client libraries published
    in this release are the same libraries that were published with
    caArray 2.1.0. (caarray_client_2_1_0.zip and caarray_api_javadoc_2_1_0.zip)


Known Issues/Defects
------------------------
 
See the GForge tracker for existing open defects, community requests, 
resolutions and feature requests. The following issues are 
highlighted. 

https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/tracker/?group_id=305

* The total import job size (defined as sum of uncompressed file sizes)
  must be less than 3GB.

* A collaborator cannot see files in the "Uploaded" state even with
  read-write permissions to the experiment.

* The installer does not support configuring SSL support in JBoss.

* After installing a local copy of caArray, you must go to
  http://<IP_address_or_host_name>:<port>/caarray in order to test
  your installation. Even if you are running the browser on the same
  machine as your caArray installation, you cannot go to
  http://localhost:<port>/caarray.

* Image files referenced in a MAGE-TAB SDRF cannot be validated or
  imported.

* Multiple MAGE-TAB imports can result in duplicate persons in the database.
