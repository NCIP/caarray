Introduction
---------------------------
 
caArray is an open-source, web and programmatically
 accessible array data management system. caArray guides the 
annotation and exchange of array data using a federated 
model of local installations whose results are shareable 
across the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG™). 
caArray furthers translational cancer research through 
acquisition, dissemination and aggregation of semantically 
interoperable array data to support subsequent analysis by 
tools and services on and off the Grid. As array technology 
advances and matures, caArray will extend its logical 
library of assay management.
