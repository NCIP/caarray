Introduction
---------------------------
 
caArray is an open-source, web and programmatically
 accessible array data management system. caArray guides the 
annotation and exchange of array data using a federated
model of local installations whose results are shareable 
across the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG™). 
caArray furthers translational cancer research through 
acquisition, dissemination and aggregation of semantically 
interoperable array data to support subsequent analysis by 
tools and services on and off the Grid. As array technology 
advances and matures, caArray will extend its logical 
library of assay management.

Known Issues/Defects
------------------------
 
See the GForge tracker for the latest use cases (implemented 
and deferred), existing open defects, community requests, 
resolutions and feature requests. The following issues are 
highlighted. 

https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/tracker/?group_id=305
-----
* 17417 If a user tries to Register with LDAP credentials, the LDAP configuration properties
  specified during the install are not used. Note that the right LDAP server settings are
  used for authenticating a user who tries to log in. It is only the Register functionality
  that is affected. Possible workarounds:
  a. User can ask the administrator of the caArray local installation to create an account
     for him/her instead of clicking on the Register link.
  b. After installation, the administrator can manually enter the configuration settings. To do so:
     1. Stop the caArray JBoss instance.
     2. Unpack the ${jboss.home}/server/default/deploy/caarray.ear file into a temporary directory. 
     3. Unpack the caarray.war file found in this temporary directory into another temporary directory.
     4. Edit the file WEB-INF/web.xml within this new temporary directory. Look for the following sections
        <context-param>
            <param-name>ldapHost</param-name>
            <param-value>ldaps://cbioweb-stage-ldap.nci.nih.gov:636/</param-value>
        </context-param>
        <context-param>
            <param-name>ldapSearchableBase</param-name>
            <param-value>ou=nci,o=nih</param-value>
        </context-param>
        <context-param>
            <param-name>ldapUserIdLabel</param-name>
            <param-value>cn</param-value>
        </context-param>
        <context-param>
            <param-name>ldap.install</param-name>
            <param-value>true</param-value>
        </context-param>

        Replace the contents of the <param-value> elements with the desired values of the LDAP
        configuration properties. They correspond to the properties from install.properties as follows:
        * ldapHost - ldap.host
        * ldapSearchableBase - ldap.searchbase
        * ldapUserIdLabel - ldap.searchprefix
        * ldap.install - inverse of ldap.authentication.disabled (e.g. if you wanted ldap.authentication.disabled = false, enter true here, and vice versa)
        Please refer to the installation guide for more detail on these configuration properties.
     5. Repack the caarray.war file, overriding the older one.
     6. Repack the caarray.ear file, and copy it back to ${jboss.home}/server/default/deploy
     7. Start the caArray JBoss instance.
-----
* 17438 When you import multiple Genepix GPR data files into an experiment, the system creates
  multiple samples for the same wavelength, instead of creating one sample.
-----
* 15421 Trying to import an Illumina data file with an SDRF where the sample names in the data file
  and the SDRF don't match: This will result in a failed import with no cause specified, instead of
  generating a validation error.
-----
* 17426 If the total import job size (defined as sum of uncompressed file sizes) is greater than 3GB, the import or validate job will fail.
-----
* 16398 Any attempt to edit an experiment while uploading files to it will result in an error.
-----
* 15409 The Experiment Permissions UI performs poorly when sample-selective access is selected and the number of samples is large.
-----
* 14630 A collaborator who uploads files cannot see them on the Manage Data page.
-----
* 16594 The local installer ignores the value of the upt.url parameter.
