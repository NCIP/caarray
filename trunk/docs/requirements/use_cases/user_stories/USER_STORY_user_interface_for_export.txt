USER STORY: User interface for export

As a caArray user, I want to export my experiment to GEO SOFT or MAGE-TAB format.

1. Flow:

* In the context of an experiment, the user chooses to export to some format.
* The system allows the user to export the experiment annotations to GEO SOFT, or to export the experiment annotations and data to a GEO SOFT archive, or to export the experiment annotations into MAGE-TAB format.
* The user chooses to export to GEO SOFT format, and picks either the annotations-only option (only the GEO SOFT file) or the annotations-plus-data option (entire GEO submission package including the GEO SOFT annotations and the data files).
* The system validates the experiment for GEO export.
* If the validation fails, the System provides the list of errors to the user.
* If the validation succeeds, the Systems performs the GEO translation and provides the GEO SOFT annotations file or archive for download.
* The user saves the download to his/her local machine.

Note: the MAGE-TAB export functionality works the same way as it currently does.
