Questions:

* Is Derived Array Data File in the wrong place in the Ordering and Cardinality table (proposal #3)? (Shouldn't it be after Normalization Name?)

* Proposal #26 says that Characteristics should be declarable just like Factor Names. But I thought we said (at Stanford) that we weren't going to do this. Please confirm.

* I noticed that in proposal #22 (ADF), term accession numbers for the following were not mentioned: Reporter Group and Control Type. Do we need Term Accession Numbers for those?
