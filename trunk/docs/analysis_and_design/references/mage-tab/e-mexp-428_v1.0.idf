"Experiment Description"	"Gene expression of TK6 cells transduced with an oncoretrovirus expressing MDR1 (TK6MDR1) was compared to untransduced TK6 cells and to TK6 cell transduced with an oncoretrovirus expressing the Neomycin resistance gene (TK6neo). Two biological replicates of each were generated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus2.0 GeneChip microarrays. Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes with expression dependent on the MDR1 overexpression."

"Protocol Description"	"TK6 cells were grown in suspension cultures in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). The cells were routinely maintained at 37 C and 5% CO2."	"Approximately 10^6 cells were lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen).Total RNA was extracted from the cell lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen)."
