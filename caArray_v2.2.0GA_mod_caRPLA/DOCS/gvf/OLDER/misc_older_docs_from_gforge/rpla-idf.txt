The .rpla-idf file
File format is derived from the MAGE-TAB spec., v1.0, January 31, 2007.
Variations from the MAGE-TAB .idf format are underlined.

An antibody used in an RPLArray must be listed here and is referenced from an .sradf file.

Multiple antibodies can be used in the experiment (following MAGE-TAB convention of using additional columns and so each antibody has its own fields).

Antibody names must be unique in the .rpla-idf file.
Antibodies in the database will not be uniquely identified by name, and will require additional fields, such as the fields below, for unique identification.
There will be a policy for matching an antibody listed in this file to an existing antibody in the database.


HUGO is one possible preferred term source for describing antibody targets.

The .rpla-idf file may point to multiple *.sradf files.

----------------------------------------------------
Validation policy notes for .rpla-idf files:

Number of columns must match up where appropriate.
Factor names cannot be identical.

There must be at least one antibody and antibody names cannot be identical

There must be at least one sradf file.
.sradf files cannot be of zero size.
Quotes around sradf filepath are optional.
All sradf files references must be found. The parser can accommodate both relative and absolute paths.
TODO: Test window paths.
Spaces, but not tabs, are allowed in sradf file path

For better readabality, new lines are allowed after
