 A sample cannot have multiple Sources
 Any spot on the array is considered a Sample.
 A sample may have a null source.
 Only one sample can be in an array location.
 Any principal ( node or edge) should have the same attributes in the same column in a section.
 Each row shoudl correspond to one complete path.
 Only "RPLA" is supported as Technology Type for Assay Type
 Any final sample should have identical Factor Values
 In Samples section, exactly one row per sample.
 (SUbsequent protocols do not imply sequential application).
 
 Need to allow for # for comments in rplaidf and sradf
 MAke sure -> is handled correctly everywhere
 
Any Sample REF must be listed in Sampels section.
All files *must* be found.
An Image File Array Data file, Derived Array Data file may be empty.

Data sheet files for Antibody to be supported in future.

notes about parser design...

regexp to capture most rules about headers, especially simple :
Principal vs. Attribute...simple rule for assigning attributes to principals
good for specifying required columns and orders
makes for top-down design
possible use as filter/classifier of valid datasets
easier to prototype, rather than deal with rules iteratively
could also be simple rules
node()
( node() | (edge())+ node())*




-----------
Display

Show expfactors, values, and characteristics for an experiment


----

simple parser doesn't need to deal with assocations between principals...why bother?
It depends on final model how these things get organized..some of these associations may not
even be supported....
will just make associations only to have to parse them later....

translator can just look at pairs of principals
e.g. Source-Sample
Source-Protocol
Sample-Sample
Protocol-Sample and so on...

subversion notes:
use major tags as starting points




Need Reporter Group???

column counts required? Flag extra tabs?
