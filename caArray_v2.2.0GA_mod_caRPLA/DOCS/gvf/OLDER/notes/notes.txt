currently only supporting import of RplaTabDocumentSets with exactly one 
rplaidf and exactly one sradf.


--why are elements added implicitly? (happens in SdrfTranslator )
	addImplicitExtracts();
			 addImplicitSamples();
			
			//any reason to add implicit sources, or implicit anything?
			// addImplicitSources();
---

currently some classes are borrowed from mage-tab domain...convenience

maybe decide on best way to proceed...will intermediary mage-tab model change?


need to add Antibody Validation section to rplaidf? 
finish terms and term validation wrt Characteristics


found this syntax in MAGE-TAB paper:

Characteristics[CellLine] OI:CTO

Check out: 
http://obo.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/detail.cgi?cell

Look at Reporter items in mage-tab and tab2mage.


Like the assumption that if not defined comes from MO?

it should be easier for researchers to understand and create *tab...


**line number reporting! need to fix


ice interface down the line?

vis: next to image, show microvigene quantified visually..

graphical display of sradf

webstart tool to help generate/validate rplatab

need to eventually parse microvigene as data matrix...



old applet:
works on linuxm windows, mac
