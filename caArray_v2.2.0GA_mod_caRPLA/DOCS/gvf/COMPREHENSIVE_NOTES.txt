occurs to me that 
"matched smaples are higher-lelev issue and probably outside of scope of this proejct,
since you don;t have such a thing, and such matching coudl easily occur in the current assay types availabale now...

so keep one assay type per experiment, replace bar2... 

---------


What does it mean to have "matched" samples?
How are they matched?

How to show desired outcome for such matching?

===========

Consider abstract notion of "linking" between experiments?
why? how? when? by whom?

can an experiment be included under multiple projects? that cuold help....

stay away from matching sets if factor values
---model of sets fo factor values...treatment groups...imaging assays, so on...

could samples also be matched by a "matching" protocol?

consider explicit internal linking.. metdata type linking

critical question: to do ww/ interface?
 change it?
 how to add to it?
 leave it alone possible?



======================




the antibody used could also be a factor value, right?




adopt same term policy as cav2? : can add terms, for antibody validation for xample?

careful with bio vs tech replciacates.

control -> technical  background with buffers etc

dmso.egf one compound treatment
 just egf, assume dmso
 
 
shoudl antibodies have site-wide scope?
can antibodies also be entered via rpla-tab?

what elements in ca2 have site-wide scope?


shoudl dilution be referred by name??

col/row can be in any order with regard to sradf


remember to verify sample names are unique





----------
matched samples, not replicates in any sense, will have same "source" and have same factor values

how to do this???





----------




use cases:

users can browse antiodies
users ( which users? ) can annotate antibodies
antibodies have own terms
antibodies have access control


upload/import/parsing/validation:

upload rpla-tab
import rpla-tab
edit?
export?

how are factor vALUES ASSOCIated explicitly?

catalog id,lot id -> gene

gene -ab name

how are genes references in ca2?


if experiment is of a different type, view changes...

an experiment cna have both mdata nd rdata
how can they be linked? by tech/bio replciate?

from teleconf of 12/04/07: for next time
wireframes with use cases
real data set(s)

GA probably end of januarya

Use "Roundtrip" on annotated model submitted by Eric

Look at new LexBig service..

==============

defend idea that using comment for this extensions is not a good idea.


======

get array data out of array express under joe gray's name to put into
caarray2


============

maybe still use javacc but make sure to 
collapse any code in the regexp chains into the 
constructors of the header object...do i need the 
hreader object??????
===========

grammar succinctly shows rules and principality of nodes

make .jj one tneth as long?



========================
absorb comments in sha1sumutility--rename function better.
===========

instead of debugPrintProtocols ( where? ) 
use somethign like toString ...referencing modeling


==========

use weak references in parser?

-----------
think about some interface hiding omeis..do tests liek they did...

---------

have secure version up for next time...

----------------



==========================



=========================
develop modules to connect bs w/ caarray2 and vice versa
	strart with limited funtionality, integrate more later...
	would be usefule experience in how to connect data
	
	options: connect via cagrid, intgeration of data modeling
	
abminer in picture?
grdify it?
--------------------------

work out use cases and web pages
changes addtitive, non additive?
can all changes in fact be additive?
-------------------

some icbp data from heidi at:

[gvf@caarray2 HTA_ICBP_Pilot]$ pwd
/data/hta/HTA_ICBP_Pilot



============================

look At use cases in brent style
and scope document

in caarray2 you can download data for a sample or set of smaples

====
where is selection of parser decided by file suffix?
====
COuld display my own validation messages upon validation of rpla-tab like
it is done ( hyperlinked for warnings) in caarray2
===============

be able to register local caarray2/carpla node on grid
so will see on browse front page


==============
do secure install/apache/jboss with real ceritifictae



------------
shoudl be considering on best way to get data in to the system?

===================
1 end startint text file

vs.

other end all through interface
===================

inbetween? interface helps generate text file?

For next teleconf:

1) put up use cases and requirements like brent's
2) timeline updated

3) add reporter-factor-value asasocaition, clean up modeling

Dec 4th

--------------------------
?
Will every spot correspond to a Sample ?
Will every control spot be a Sample?
DMSO can be considered a biomaterial

IS there a way to differentiate samples based on treatment ? how?

need rplarray -surface type as term : assocaition to term

where do hardware specs go

will need to uplaod protocol files such as "Prep of Cell lysate for rpla"

what ios streptavidin-biotin complex  used for?

---

extremely challenging to figure out a way to get from the mass of excel
files to something verifiable and clear


----------------

since this is basically "new" :
considering the following for user-ease:

1) all from rpla-tab . use some interface widgets to make edits/corrections, will need others to make 
otehr sorts of edits

2) some from rpla-tab same as above for edits, will need nes widgtes to enter information

================


in mage, controltype brlongd to super class DesignElement

caarray2, moved this to PhysicalProbe
?in carpla:
moved to rplarrayreporter

=========
set caarray entitiy super class correctly everywhere






-------------
had iterated claims that 

array != rplarray
rplarray has no array design file per se, the array is the arraydesign
it is not a microarray
does not have 0..1 with organism
Abstract probe annotation doesn't apply to rplarray ( but actuaklly may be useful( doubtful) for the Ab)

Entity vs object...entity is to be externally referenceable

---------

time to login, ,maybe looking for ldap


should new type of smaple be linked to factor value? or just reporter?


---
cacore dsk only really used in evs utility and mged ontology lookerupper

------

get info from heidi, same sample has rplarray and microarray data

------

add surface type term thingie to rplarray


----

rplatab providers and performers delimited by semicolons


--------

comment[name] allowable in rpla-idf

------------

handle -> 

------

can have multiple MaterialTypes?

---
is array data file required?

We are deploying caarray2 on
caarray2.lbl.gov ( more for production deployment of caarray2 straight )
and 
cox.lbl.gov ( more for development iterations using carpla)

caarray2 is up now, will be updating from SVN on a regular basis.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
besides managing imaging data, my group is also involved in microarray data management and analysis
and in the background, I'm going to push for caarray2 adoption locally. 

just one group the hta group has about 
3000 cel files.
which come from about 30 experiments

we also have microarray data for the icbp project...




while getting to knwo the system, introduce potential users around here, 
see if i can migrate some of their data so they can adopt caarray2 as data annotation/distribution.

Lots of data from heidi? how much? is a ht system, also get feedback from here
3000 cel files.
about 30 exports

appears to be no explicit links between factor value and Measurement, or Protocol or what? Weren't these there before in mage?
I think mage had pointed to measurement.

Does cabio have array reporter?

are protocols shared? can you edit a protocol?



use cases changed?

get rplarrays for a given experiment
retrieve rplarrays that use a given Ab ( by how? hugo name..provider..manufacturrer....by validation result, etc...)?

retrieve biosource-biosample chains for a given rplarray

retrieve and display tiff-cionverted-to-jpeg for a given rplarray

retrieve all data files for a particular rplarray? and what if data files span multiple arrays?

Ab validation

data is somewhat slow coming, antibody validation still critical.

Ab validation (and possible use of abminer) still very critical.

will be including images/quantitation/ results of rppa : wasterns..grpahs comparing correlation of the two methods

want western to show single-predominant band?  low background/high signal

can have different results with differnet cell types

different results in cell lines v.s tissues

SOP very important!
buffer conditions

provider
catalog no
lot no
validated by

at least 8 samples for validation along with correlation coefficient
include a treated smaple where level of specific protein is supposed to be altered
 ideally at least 4 cell lines
 
 what western quantitation software would be used?

with quantitated western

so would this effectively be an ab validation database



abminer
635 available abs with validation by westerns
"immunogen"
vendor
antigen
corresponding gene

western bands: single band, multiple band, wrong molecular weight, no band

show western images for ab


shoudl abmier terms go in controlled vocab? along with possible values?


ab validation: important for reproduciblity






Reproducibility has been hard:
Variability with lot id

Variability  with protocol VERY IMPORTANT
Confirm protocol application everyhere needed....

-----is a protocol linked to a source and a sample? do i know if it is explicitly how sample was created?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Talk about test data from heidi
Having looked through some of the data, there appears to be a ****very citical need for data management, distribution
in this icbp program***. There is no sort of formalized dataset format that easily shows people what's going on.
There are no apparent controlled terminologies for samples, controls, for example...
there is a need to sort out this data. I'd like to use this data as test data for carpla deployment using caarray2.
Need to adopt the data in this form and get into system

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So since this has to do with the actual format and organization of the data
First address eric's question about using comments
really should be first class citizens..

Have gone through wire frames and interfaces : What works and what won't work:




In Propose Experiment 
-----------------------------------------------
need to add correct assay type rather than 
gene expression
SNP
DNA
aCGH
---------

There can be multiple organisms tissue types/sites, cell types











How does current system handle mage-tab?

Is particular validation method chosen by file suffix?


Data will be available for editing in the interface, so the existing rpla-tab file will not be correct. right?
So should export of an experiment in the form of an rpla-tab dataset be possible?

Does the current system export a mage-tab file set? Or would a module need to be written to do this?

RPLA-TAB validation and notes

I made some changes in the format in that protocol types wouldn't be hardwired and required.
Putting those changes in currently...






list validation rules which make it different than mage-tab




Validation shoud involve resolving references to data files ( images, array data, derived array data)
This could be done on the client or server. Previously, I was doing this on the client, where the applet 
could look in the local directory for all referenced files when pointed to an rpla-idf file.

Or it could be done on the server:
*Is it the case that a validated mage-tab file set is validated when all referenced files have been
 uploaded and found?*..
If so, then names for files within a workspace would need to be unique, correct? 
The simplest implementation would imply that.

  apparently comment can appear anywhere in an rpla-idf file or anywhere in sdrf and sradf....





*** important---
Changes from last time: no more fixed name protocols since this would be pulling it away from the genericity of magetab


nned to deal with <-


current vlaidation passes through grammar for header patterns.
this serves to effectibely encapslate many rules that would be harder to express...
such as:


or enforcing in code: such as:
also eserves to communicate more succinctly possible patterns..

regexpression could also be used to generate all possible paths...
useful for  showing users...



could it also be used to enforce site-specific rules? such as?
wouldn't this be tricky?

related: how might new column headers be added and incorporated into parser?





-----------------------------


validation:stuff

verify sradf exists and is not of zero size

verify unique spot locations in locaiton section

verify not extra tabs in header or rows ( check number of columns everywhere)

a source or sample cannot have differing characteristics: exmaple:

same smaple name not duplicated in samples section


same array cannot have different array creation protocols
same image file cannot have different acquistion protocols

sample name in locaitons section must reference samples section

array name in data section must rerfeffence array name in location section


validate all against ontlogy terms?

what if term is not known in system? need to put there first?

doesn;t work

verify images are not corrupt: convert tiffs to jpegs for viewing in browser...

rpla-tab uses names of files..must they be unique within scope of the application? 
in other words, say user uploads the files, will they be found by name in the workspace?
can you upload data files with same name?

how does caarray2 deal with say samples that have the same names as other experiments?

how would a new rpla-tab or any mage-tab dataset reference existing sources or samples? 

how will rplarrays be differentiated from other arrays in caarray2? apples and oranges...
( same array arraygroup thing as well?) 




----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

how are controls handled? in different systems, i've seen controls relegated to second class citizens where they are in fact
critically important and i can't see a reason to not make them more explicit.


negative antibody control: which does not recognize any human antigen ( in pnas paper)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issue with identifiers:

issue with identifiers/lsid references...

how able to establish equivalence between samples, sources, etc...? 
when is this important?

for what columsn are lsid identifiers important?

does dataset use lsid inderntiders? yes, check local db, exists? no create, yes, display

Misc:

* We are comparing protein levels across samples  rather than comparing sames across protein types



* as technology progresses there will be higher density robotically spotted rplarrays

* Tie in biosig image modeling?
  

---------------------


could develop graphical tools or interactive tools to help generate sradf files
would need template-type files?



------------------------


how ouwld ed column headers be added and incorporated into existingparser?


could use OBO--could use OBO terms in some particular namespace ( obo::) as column headers?
look at OBO for celllines....
